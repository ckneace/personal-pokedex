I grew up playng pokemon and I got interest on this personal pokedex. I love most things about pokemon, having a resource that can help
with progression of the game sounds really interesting. I got interested especially because some of my family members started
pokemon recently with quarantine life I found that it would be useful to have pokedex application. I can conribute by
focusing on the database side (purpose of the class) and/or back-end with the group.

Comments----
-- buiness- There are lots of pokemon information online with only few official sites. I believe this will be helplful and useful for the players
-- Legal - I believe it really depends on Nintendo Legal side of it
-- Technical - I believe it really depends on the how we use API and what exactly we want to do it, but it sounds simple and using the purpose of database
